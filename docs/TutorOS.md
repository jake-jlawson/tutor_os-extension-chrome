# TutorOS Overview
TutorOS is a web-based platform designed to make tutoring significantly easier, more effective, and more professional for both tutors and students. Its vision is to be the “operating system for tutors”: a unified set of tools that streamlines how lessons are prepared, delivered, recorded, analyzed, and reported. At its core, TutorOS manages lessons, students, and teaching sessions. It integrates with meeting platforms (Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, etc.) and adds a layer of automation and intelligence around the live tutoring experience.

Key value propositions:
- Efficiency: tutors spend less time on admin and report writing, more time actually teaching.
- Transparency: clear, structured lesson logs and transcripts give students/parents visibility into progress.
- Effectiveness: built-in analysis of lessons helps tutors improve delivery and helps students get more out of each session.
- Scalability: the system is designed to eventually support agencies, multi-tutor organizations, and a whole ecosystem of educational products.

The long-term vision includes:
- Full lesson lifecycle management (planning → delivery → reporting → review).
- Automatic recording and transcription of lessons.
- AI-powered analysis: extracting key topics, student questions, and action items.
- Auto-generated lesson reports and next-lesson plans.
- Dashboards for tutors, students, and parents.
- Additional modules (e.g., matching tutors to students, scheduling, payments).

In short, TutorOS is the tutor’s productivity platform, where delivering and reviewing high-quality lessons feels smooth, efficient, and professional.
